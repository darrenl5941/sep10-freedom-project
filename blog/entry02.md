# Entry 2: Hardware and Software in the Stock Market
##### 11/12/2024

## Stock Market Software
**Software** is things such as apps, or anything that does not physically exist. In the _stock market_ some **software** includes _stock trading apps_ which allow for easy managment of stocks or other features in stocks that are exclusive to these apps such as _fractional shares_ which I will talk about later.

One of these _stock market apps_ is [**Robinhood**](https://robinhood.com/us/en/), which has 11 million monthly users. A review from [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/is-robinhood-safe/#:~:text=The%20trading%20platform%20Robinhood%20is,amounts%20for%20cash%20and%20securities) lists many of the app's positives and why you should trust it:

* _Robinhood_ is regulated by the _Securities Investor Protection Corp_ and _Securities and Exchange Commision_ which means that it is secure
* They charge nothing for comisions and have no account minimums
* They have up to a $50 million coverage on what they manage

Another _stock market app_ is [**Webull**](https://www.webull.com/). It has many benefits, but it also has a few negatives as talked about by [Broker Chooser](https://brokerchooser.com/broker-reviews/webull-review#:~:text=Webull%20is%20a%20legit%20brokerage,not%20publish%20any%20financial%20information):

* They allow for free stock trading and give 5% intrest on uninvested cash
* It is quick and easy to make an account with them
* They have a limited portfolio of stocks
* You can only deposit and withdraw cash in it though a bank
* Poor support on phones

If neither of those two _stock market apps_ seem like something you weould want to use a third option is [Public](https://public.com/?wpsrc=Organic+Search&wpsn=www.google.com). 

* They have _fractional shares_ (buy smaller versions of an expensive stock for a cheaper price)
* They have a low trade minimum with no commissions
* It is made to be used by beginners, buy & hold investors, or people who use fractional shares
* It has a lack of mutual funds
* it's main focus is on beginners in the stock market and stock trading

## Stock Market Hardware

**Hardware** is the physical things that are used, such as _monitors_ or _quantum devices_. Usually _software_ goes on **hardware** and is needed for _software_ to work.

One of the most important peices of _hardware_ used in _the stock market_ is monitors. ["How to Set Up Your Trading Screens"](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/081215/how-set-your-trading-screens.asp#:~:text=Given%20that%20the%20average%20monitor,to%20switch%20between%20different%20windows) talks about how monitors are needed to keep track of multiple stocks or metrics at once without having to swap tabs as most monitors can fit around 3 or 4 graphs at once. Some good monitors for _the stock market_ are talked about in ["Best Monitors for Trading in 2024"](https://www.techradar.com/pro/best-monitors-for-trading-in-year#:~:text=The%20Asus%20ProArt%2032%2Dinch,a%20responsive%20and%20sharp%20monitor):

* They reccomend the **Asus ProArt PA328CGV (32-inch)** for beginners and intermediates as it isn't overpriced and still has a refresh rate of 165Hz (Hertz)
* For those experienced in _the stock market_, the **Samsung Odyssey CRG9** is recommended as it can hold many graphs with its ultrawide ratio of 32:9
* If you are on a low budget they recommend the **Acer SB220Q bi (21.5-inch)** as it it at a relativly cheap price of _$100_

Another peice of _hardware_ that is needed for the stock market are **FPGAs** (field-programmable gate arrays). Explained in ["How are FPGAs Used in Trading?"](https://www.imc.com/us/articles/how-are-fpgas-used-in-trading) by [IMC](https://www.imc.com/us), they are small computer chips with low latency, high preformance, and energy efficiency which are very useful as they can be coded to do many things. In _the stock market_ **FGPAs** are used to make _trading algorithms_ that check to make sure trades in stocks are fair.

A more advanced peice of _hardware_ is **quantum devices**
