# Entry 2: Hardware and Software in the Stock Market
##### 11/12/2024

## Stock Market Software (Stock Market Apps)
**Software** is things such as apps, or anything that does not physically exist. In the _stock market_ some **software** includes _stock trading apps_ which allow for easy managment of stocks or other features in stocks that are exclusive to these apps such as _fractional shares_ which I will talk about later.

### Robinhood

[**Robinhood**](https://robinhood.com/us/en/) is one of these _stock market apps_. It is one of the more popular ones with its 11 million monthly users. A review from [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/is-robinhood-safe/#:~:text=The%20trading%20platform%20Robinhood%20is,amounts%20for%20cash%20and%20securities) lists many of the app's positives and why you should trust it:

* _Robinhood_ is regulated by the _Securities Investor Protection Corp_ and _Securities and Exchange Commision_ which means that it is secure
* They charge nothing for comisions and have no account minimums
* They have up to a $50 million coverage on what they manage

### Webull

[**Webull**](https://www.webull.com/) is another _stock market app_. It has many benefits, but it also has a few negatives as talked about by [Broker Chooser](https://brokerchooser.com/broker-reviews/webull-review#:~:text=Webull%20is%20a%20legit%20brokerage,not%20publish%20any%20financial%20information):

* They allow for free stock trading and give 5% intrest on uninvested cash
* It is quick and easy to make an account with them
* They have a limited portfolio of stocks
* You can only deposit and withdraw cash in it though a bank
* Poor support on phones

### Public

[**Public**](https://public.com/?wpsrc=Organic+Search&wpsn=www.google.com) is a third option, although it is better for those who are newer to _the stock market_. Here are some of the things said about it in a review by [Bankrate](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/public-review/?tpt=b):

* They have _fractional shares_ (buy smaller versions of an expensive stock for a cheaper price)
* They have a low trade minimum with no commissions
* It is made to be used by beginners, buy & hold investors, or people who use fractional shares
* It has a lack of mutual funds
* it's main focus is on beginners in the stock market and stock trading

## Stock Market Hardware

**Hardware** is the physical things that are used, such as _monitors_ or _quantum devices_. Usually _software_ goes on **hardware** and is needed for _software_ to work.

### Monitors

One of the most important peices of _hardware_ used in _the stock market_ is **monitors**. ["How to Set Up Your Trading Screens"](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/081215/how-set-your-trading-screens.asp#:~:text=Given%20that%20the%20average%20monitor,to%20switch%20between%20different%20windows) talks about how monitors are needed to keep track of multiple stocks or metrics at once without having to swap tabs as most monitors can fit around 3 or 4 graphs at once. Some good monitors for _the stock market_ are talked about in ["Best Monitors for Trading in 2024"](https://www.techradar.com/pro/best-monitors-for-trading-in-year#:~:text=The%20Asus%20ProArt%2032%2Dinch,a%20responsive%20and%20sharp%20monitor):

* They reccomend the **Asus ProArt PA328CGV (32-inch)** for beginners and intermediates as it isn't overpriced and still has a refresh rate of 165Hz (Hertz)
* For those experienced in _the stock market_, the **Samsung Odyssey CRG9** is recommended as it can hold many graphs with its ultrawide ratio of 32:9
* If you are on a low budget they recommend the **Acer SB220Q bi (21.5-inch)** as it it at a relativly cheap price of _$100_

### Field-programmable gate arrays (FGPAs)

Another peice of _hardware_ that is needed for the stock market are **FPGAs** (field-programmable gate arrays). Explained in ["How are FPGAs Used in Trading?"](https://www.imc.com/us/articles/how-are-fpgas-used-in-trading) by [IMC](https://www.imc.com/us), they are small computer chips with low latency, high preformance, and energy efficiency which are very useful as they can be coded to do many things. In _the stock market_ **FGPAs** are used to make _trading algorithms_ that check to make sure trades in stocks are fair.

### Quantum Devices

A more advanced peice of _hardware_ is **quantum devices**. Explained in ["Existing quantum devices could be used to disrupt the stock market"](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2443170-existing-quantum-devices-could-be-used-to-disrupt-the-stock-market/), by NewScientist, **quantum devices** can be used for nearly instant selling and buying of stocks as well as coordinating the buying and selling of stocks with others. 

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

I am currently in the _second step_ of the _Engineering Design Process_ with the goal of **researching the problem**. I am researching _hardware_ and _software_ that is used in _the stock market_ and i have found things such as _stock market apps_, _FPGAs_, _monitors_, and _quantum devices_.

## Skills

### How to Google

During the research for _hardware_ and _software_ I had to learn to **be more specific** while _googling_. When I searched ['devices in the stock market'](https://www.google.com/search?q=devices+in+the+stock+market&sca_esv=f9749d82eb8de094&rlz=1C5GCCM_en&biw=2048&bih=1064&ei=otIfZ9_OLs6s5NoPwtaP6AM&ved=0ahUKEwjfp7Ce1bGJAxVOFlkFHULrAz0Q4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=devices+in+the+stock+market&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiG2RldmljZXMgaW4gdGhlIHN0b2NrIG1hcmtldDIKEAAYsAMY1gQYRzIKEAAYsAMY1gQYRzIKEAAYsAMY1gQYRzIKEAAYsAMY1gQYRzIKEAAYsAMY1gQYRzIKEAAYsAMY1gQYRzIKEAAYsAMY1gQYRzIKEAAYsAMY1gQYR0ivCVDIB1jIB3ABeACQAQCYATqgAXOqAQEyuAEDyAEA-AEBmAICoAJCmAMA4gMFEgExIECIBgGQBgiSBwEyoAesCw&sclient=gws-wiz-serp&safe=active&ssui=on), it showed stocks instead of hardware that was used in the stock market. So after looking htrough some of the websites and finding a website that quickly went over _monitors_ I searched ['what are some companies that make monitors for stock trading'](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+are+some+companies+that+make+monitors+for+stock+trading&rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS904US904&oq=what+are+some+companies+that+make+monitors+for+stock+trading&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyCQgAEEUYORigATIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRifBdIBCDg4MDNqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on) so i could get more specific websites.

### Fact Checking

Another skill that I learned while researching is **fact checking**. While researching _software_ in _the stock market_ multiple apps poped up. To check that they were good I looked at _reviews_ for those apps and looked over the positives and negatives the review had for the app.

### Time Management

A skill that I learned while writing this _blog_ is **time managment**. I have been working on this _blog_ in small parts over multiple days so i can work on it for an _hour every day_ instead of having to spend multiple hours at once before it is due to finish it. I would work on the _software_ part one day, then _hardware_ the next day, and start working on other parts on other days.

## Summary

When _researching_ it is important to _manage your time_. If you do you can do the work in smaller portions. _Managing your time_ also allows you to spend time _googling for specific things_ to make sure you can find what you are looking for and _fact check_ to make sure what you find is accurate.
