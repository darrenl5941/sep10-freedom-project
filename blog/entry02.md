## Stock Market Software
**Software** is things such as apps, or anything that does not physically exist. In the _stock market_ some **software** includes _stock trading apps_ which allow for easy managment of stocks or other features in stocks that are exclusive to these apps such as _fractional shares_ which I will talk about later.

One of these _stock market apps_ is [**Robinhood**](https://robinhood.com/us/en/), which has 11 million monthly users. A review from [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/is-robinhood-safe/#:~:text=The%20trading%20platform%20Robinhood%20is,amounts%20for%20cash%20and%20securities) lists many of the app's positives and why you should trust it:

* _Robinhood_ is regulated by the _Securities Investor Protection Corp_ and _Securities and Exchange Commision_ which means that it is secure
* They charge nothing for comisions and have no account minimums
* They have up to a $50 million coverage on what they manage

Another _stock market app_ is [**Webull**](https://www.webull.com/). It has many benefits, but it also has a few negatives as talked about by [Broker Chooser](https://brokerchooser.com/broker-reviews/webull-review#:~:text=Webull%20is%20a%20legit%20brokerage,not%20publish%20any%20financial%20information):

* They allow for free stock trading and give 5% intrest on uninvested cash
