## Choosing A topic
I decided to make my topic the **Stock Market and Investments** because I have always found investments and making educated predictions interesting. I know the basics of the stock market but I would like to learn more about how it works and waht is behind it which is why I chose this for my Freedom Project. My backup ideas were Venture Capital and Law Practice/Lawfirms, but I chose the Stock Market and Invcestments because I had more intrest in it and it has a higher chance of being useful to me. Some of the articles that I looked at are ["What is Blockchain?"](https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain) by IBM, ["Big Data in Stock Market: A Comprehensive Overview"](https://academy.musaffa.com/big-data-in-the-stock-market/#:~:text=Big%20data%20facilitates%20improved%20risk,risks%20and%20market%20volatility%20patterns.) by Musaffa Academy
