## Choosing A topic
I decided to make my topic the **Stock Market and Investments** because I have always found investments and making educated predictions interesting. I know the basics of the stock market but I would like to learn more about how it works and waht is behind it which is why I chose this for my Freedom Project. My backup ideas were Venture Capital and Law Practice/Lawfirms, but I chose the Stock Market and Investments because I had more intrest in it and it has a higher chance of being useful to me.  

Some of the articles that I looked at for the Stock Market are ["What is Blockchain?"](https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain) by IBM, and ["Big Data in Stock Market: A Comprehensive Overview"](https://academy.musaffa.com/big-data-in-the-stock-market/#:~:text=Big%20data%20facilitates%20improved%20risk,risks%20and%20market%20volatility%20patterns.) by Musaffa Academy. Some of the articles I looked at for my backup topics (Venture Capital and Law Practice/Lawfirms) are ["The VC tech stack: Tools to streamline & automate venture deals"](https://www.affinity.co/guides/the-vc-tech-stack-tools-to-streamline-automate-venture-deals#:~:text=Download%20guide-,What%20is%20a%20venture%20capital%20tech%20stack%3F,stages%20of%20the%20dealmaking%20process.) by Affinity, and ["What is Legal Technology?"](https://www.clio.com/resources/legal-technology/what-is-legal-technology/) by Clio.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
I am currently on the first step of the Engineering Design Process, defining the problem. The problem that I am trying to solve is that many **people don't know how to properly invest or manage stocks.** Many people just invest in random stocks or big stocks of well known companies leading to them not gaining much out of their stocks. People also don't check their stocks ofthen enough which leads to them not realizing if one of thier stocks skyrockets or if the company they invested in is about to go bankrupt, causing their stocks in that company to dissapear.

## Skills
Some of the skills I learned while working on this blog are **time managment**, **how to google**, and **fact checking**

#### Time Management
Usually when I have any homework I would put it off untill the last minute and do it then. But with this project I thought over about how I do my work and decided that I should start doing the work in smaller portions threwout the time I have to do it incase some other importnat work also becomes due soon at the same time. I know that this will help me because it means that I don't have to cram all the work into a short period of time and can think about more ideas during the whole period of time that I am given.

#### How to Google
When researchng for my topic, _Investments and the Stock Market_, many results would pop up when I would search something like [technology in the stock market](https://www.google.com/search?q=technology+in+the+stock+market&rlz=1C5GCCM_en&oq=technology+in+the+stock+market&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDQ3MTFqMGoxqAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on). So, I would quickly look over some of the things that were talked about in articles and then search for a more specific peice of technology like [what is blockchain technology](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+blockchain+technology&rlz=1C5GCCM_en&oq=what+is+blockchain+technology&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDU5MzVqMGoxqAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on). Doing this allows me to find a peice of technology I might not know much about and then get more sources about that peice of technology by searching for it specifically.

#### Fact Checking
While writing this blog I learns that you should look at multiple trustable sources that go over the same topic. This is important because some websites might have inaccurate or wrong information. An example of this is when I searched _what is blockchain technology_, I then looked at two articles, one from [_Amazon Web Services_](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/blockchain/#:~:text=AWS%20Blockchain%20services%3F-,What%20is%20blockchain%20technology%3F,linked%20together%20in%20a%20chain.) and one by [_IBM_](https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain).
