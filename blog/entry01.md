## Choosing A topic
I decided to make my topic the **Stock Market and Investments** because I have always found investments and making educated predictions interesting. I know the basics of the stock market but I would like to learn more about how it works and waht is behind it which is why I chose this for my Freedom Project. My backup ideas were Venture Capital and Law Practice/Lawfirms, but I chose the Stock Market and Investments because I had more intrest in it and it has a higher chance of being useful to me.  

Some of the articles that I looked at for the Stock Market are ["What is Blockchain?"](https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain) by IBM, and ["Big Data in Stock Market: A Comprehensive Overview"](https://academy.musaffa.com/big-data-in-the-stock-market/#:~:text=Big%20data%20facilitates%20improved%20risk,risks%20and%20market%20volatility%20patterns.) by Musaffa Academy. Some of the articles I looked at for my backup topics (Venture Capital and Law Practice/Lawfirms) are ["The VC tech stack: Tools to streamline & automate venture deals"](https://www.affinity.co/guides/the-vc-tech-stack-tools-to-streamline-automate-venture-deals#:~:text=Download%20guide-,What%20is%20a%20venture%20capital%20tech%20stack%3F,stages%20of%20the%20dealmaking%20process.) by Affinity, and ["What is Legal Technology?"](https://www.clio.com/resources/legal-technology/what-is-legal-technology/) by Clio.
