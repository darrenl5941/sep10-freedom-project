## Content

### Brainstorming Part B (Possible Future Technology)

---

#### Stock Market Predictors

I came up with this idea by looking at something that is _fake_ and thinking about how it would work and help if it were real. Stock Market Predictors are supposed to help people get an accurate prediction of what would happen to stocks in the stock market.

---

#### Stocks as Currency

I thought of this idea by looking at _crypto currencies_, which are supposed to be used as a digital currency. The idea is that people would be able to create their own digital currencies that would just be stocks that are not connected to anything.

---

#### Advanced Stock Tracking Apps

I thought of this idea by looking at something that already exists, _stock tracking apps_ and thinking about how they could be improved. If they looked at things relating to a company a stock is connected to or the field the stock is in then more accurate tracking would be able to be done.

### Finalizing My Content

While _finalizing our content_ we went over everything. We split up the information into more groups and reorganized it. While finalizing it I also added in some more images and the links to them like an image of a [FPGA (Field Programable Gate Array)](https://e7.pngegg.com/pngimages/166/133/png-clipart-microcontroller-field-programmable-gate-array-xilinx-electronics-jtag-others-electronics-electronic-device-thumbnail.png) and a image of a [monitor (screen)](https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/hGjxeJS26v_yBP1F4_-c1u1Ftzs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-699098011-793148ad63904565b2779ac7aaf93d53.jpg). I also reorganized the links to websites by putting them in indented bullet points under the topic they were about so they were easier to find.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)

I am currently in the fourth step of the _EDP_, planning a promising solution. I did this by thinking of future innovations and technology that could be used in _the stock market_. This includes the ideas I had such as _stock market predictors_, _stocks as currency_, and _advanced stock tracking apps_. All of those things could make managing stocks more convenient and easy or give them more uses in society.

## Skills

### Organization

One skill I learned during this part of the _Freedom Project_ was **organization**. I had reorganize all the things that I researched into different groups and make sure it was easy to tell what belonged where. I did this by using _indented bullet points_ which allowed for me to tell what was a smaller topic or information in a topic by looking at how indented the bullet point was. On top of that I would rename links so they wouldn't be as long and I would know where they were leading to such as a ['FPGA image'](https://e7.pngegg.com/pngimages/166/133/png-clipart-microcontroller-field-programmable-gate-array-xilinx-electronics-jtag-others-electronics-electronic-device-thumbnail.png) and a ['monitor image'](https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/hGjxeJS26v_yBP1F4_-c1u1Ftzs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-699098011-793148ad63904565b2779ac7aaf93d53.jpg).

### Creativity

Another skill that I learned was **creativity** when we had to come up with ideas for _possible future technology_ in our topic. I had to think of what would help in my topic _the stock market_, so I thought of things that would make managing stocks more convenient or predictable such as stock market predictors or advanced stock tracking apps.

---

### Checking Information

While thinking of possible future technology I also needed to learn how to **check information**. I needed to make sure that the ideas I came up with didn't already exist to make sure that they are _future_ innovations. When I did find that one of the ideas I came up with like apps that would track stocks I thought of how they could be improved instead and make that into a future piece of technology instead.

---

## Summary

Some important skills that I learned and the reasons they are important are the following:

* **Organization** is important because it makes it easier to find things later on. Without it a lot of the content I have for my website would be hard to find and it would be hard to figure out what belongs where on the website later on when I have to make it,
* **Creativity** is important because it allows you to come up with ideas that could be extremely useful in the future and could become important innovations.
* **Checking information** is important because it can make sure you are not accidentally stealing an already existing idea or concept when you are using your creativity to come up with new ideas.
