### Making a Plan

Before starting to make by website I started by making a plan. I first made multiple **wireframes** to plan out how my website should look for different screen sizes. Although I changed some things from how I planned it out in my wireframe it was important for me to make wireframes because it gave me a base for how I wanted it to look, and it saved me time from having to change everything and moving around more complex elements because I already knew where I wanted everything.
