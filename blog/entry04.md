### What tool I chose

The tool I chose to learn is **jQuery**, which is a tool or library that is based on _JavaScript_. It allowes for more efficent use of _JavaScript_ by allowing you to do more with more simple and less coding or writing. It makes simple tasks that would take many lines of code into something you can call with only 1 line to make it work.
