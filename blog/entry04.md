### What tool I chose

The tool I chose to learn is **jQuery**, which is a _tool_ or _library_ that is based on _JavaScript_. It allows for more efficient use of _JavaScript_ by allowing you to do more with more simple and less coding or writing. It makes simple tasks that would take many lines of code into something you can call with only 1 line to make it work.

### Tinkering with jQuery

One example of me tinkering with _jQuery_ was when I made a basic function that would create the message, "I am great" that would appear when the webpage is first loaded. Here is the code:

``` js
$(document).ready(function() {

    $message = "I am great";
    test($message);

    function test($message) {

        alert($message);

    }

});
```

I then tried changing some things and tinkering around with the code. I changed the variable `message` to `hi` and made it print the message `"Hello world"`. Here is the code:

``` js
$(document).ready(function() {
    $hi = "Hello world";
    test($hi);

    function test($hi) {

        alert($hi);

    }

})
```

## Sources

To _learn jQuery_ I watched two youtube videos. The first video showed me [how to obtain the CDN](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwUOsRlDTLQ). This CDN (content delivery network) allowed me to use the jQuery library. I then watched a video on [the basics of jQuery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7Nwq7319X4) which taught me how to use it.

## Skills

### Learning on my own

Throughout learning jQuery I had to _research everything about it on my own_. For example, to figure out how to get jQuery in my IDE I had to search for [how to get jQuery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwUOsRlDTLQ). This has taught me how to be more self reliant on learning and to try and figure things out on my own before asking others for help.

### Creativity

To truly learn how to use jQuery I had to _experiement and make my own code_. This made sure I understood how the code worded and that I wasn't just copying code without understanding it such as changing the value of variables and seeing how it changes the results from other parts of my code.
